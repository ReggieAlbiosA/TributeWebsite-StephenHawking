            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Stephen William Hawking was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, to Frank and Isobel Hawking. He grew up in St Albans, Hertfordshire.</li>
                <li>He studied physics at the University of Oxford, where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1962.</li>

            <h2>Early Career and Diagnosis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1963, Hawking began his graduate studies at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he pursued research in cosmology and theoretical physics.</li>
                <li>At the age of 21, he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Doctors initially gave him a very short life expectancy, but he defied the odds and lived for many decades with the condition.</li>

            <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Black Hole Radiation (Hawking Radiation): In 1974, Hawking proposed that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This theory, known as Hawking radiation, revolutionized our understanding of black holes and their eventual evaporation.</li>
                <li>Cosmology and Theoretical Physics: Throughout his career, Hawking made significant contributions to the fields of cosmology, quantum gravity, and the study of the early universe. His work often bridged the gap between Einstein's theory of relativity and quantum mechanics.</li>

            <h2>Popularity and Public Engagement</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hawking became widely recognized beyond academic circles due to his popular science books, including the bestseller "A Brief History of Time" (1988), which explained complex scientific concepts to a general audience.</li>
                <li>He was known for his distinctive synthesized voice, used to communicate due to his ALS.</li>

                    <h2>An Unconventional Love Story | The Theory Of Everything (2014) | Screen Bites</h2>
                    <p>The difficulties of dealing with Stephen's (Eddie Redmayne) disease were too much for Jane (Felicity Jones) who was isolated and overwrought. However, even when Stephen and Jane Hawking's marriage petered out gradually, they showed great care, respect and appreciation for each other. Jane ended up falling for another in Jonathan Jones (Charlie Cox) who she then married. </p>
